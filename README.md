<b>About Me!</b>
<hr>
<p>
I am Geetansh Kalra, Currently working as a Data Scientist in ThoughtWorks.

I like to be a learner because there is always room for improvement.
I have gained interest in the field of AI and it excites me how AI is changing the world. I believe in the power of writing programs and algorithms as these are the tools that can transform and improve the lives of people around the world.


'Great goals can be achieved if everyone works together' and that's what I am - a team player.
